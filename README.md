# Real-time Weather Application
This Weather Application is a web-based project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to get real-time weather information for any location. By integrating with a weather API, it provides accurate details about the current weather conditions, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description, based on the user's query.

# Features
1. Real-Time Weather Data: Displays live weather information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions (clear, cloudy, rainy, etc.) for any city.
2. Search Functionality: Users can search for weather details by entering a city name.
3. Responsive Design: The app is fully responsive, making it accessible and functional on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
4. Weather Icons: Uses icons to visually represent weather conditions (sun, clouds, rain, etc.), enhancing the user experience.
5. Easy-to-Use Interface: Simple and intuitive layout, allowing users to quickly access the weather information they need.

# Technologies Used:
- HTML for the structure of the webpage.
- CSS for styling the layout and making the app visually appealing and user-friendly.
- JavaScript to fetch weather data from the weather API and update the UI dynamically.
- OpenWeatherMap API (or any other weather API) for fetching real-time weather data.

# How it Works:
1. Enter a city name into the search bar.
2. The application uses JavaScript to make an API call to the weather service.
3. Displays real-time weather data on the page including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description.
4. The app updates the displayed weather data instantly when a new city is searched.

# API Integration:
- This weather app uses the OpenWeatherMap API (or another weather API) to retrieve real-time weather data. Youâ€™ll need to sign up for an API key from OpenWeatherMap (or your chosen API provider) to make it work.
